/**
 * Build of Materials format (BOM)
 *
 * BOM files are a nonstandard archive format originating in NeXTSTEP and
 * since used in OS X package installers and compiled asset archives.
 *
 * The structure of a BOM file is simple, with three major file sections
 * described by a header at the start of the file. Most fields stored in
 * BOM files are big endian.
 *
 * The first section of a BOM file is the index. This contains a list of
 * file offsets into the data section and a length, identified by index.
 * The BOM index is used for both data in the BOM format itself, as well
 * as for contents within the data section to refer to other data. After
 * the index list is the free list, which presumably lists available data
 * segments that can be filled by later index insertions.
 *
 * The next section is the variables. BOM variables have a name and an
 * index into the index section pointing to the variable's data.
 *
 * Finally, the data section contains the data pointed to by the BOM index.
 */

/**
 * BOM Tree format
 *
 * Some BOM variables contain trees, most commonly the "Paths" variable
 * found in standard BOM archives. BOM trees are a header in the variable's
 * data section with an index pointing to the root of the tree. Each item
 * in the tree has indexes pointing to both key and value data for that item.
